                Darwin Project takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic landscape in the Northern Canadian Rockies. 
                As preparation for an impending Ice Age, a new project- half science experiment, half live-entertainment- 
                is launched. Players are dropped into an arena, initially armed with only an axe and a bow, and have to gather 
                resources and survive along with 9 others. Players must craft items and upgrade their weapons (axe and bow) 
                using resources in order to survive and fight until only one player remains, winning the game.
